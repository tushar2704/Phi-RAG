# Phi-RAG

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation using Phi models for enhanced question-answering capabilities.

## Description

Phi-RAG is a project that combines the power of Phi language models with RAG techniques to create more accurate and context-aware responses. It retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base before generating answers, leading to more informed and precise outputs.

## Features

- 🤖 Integration with Phi language models
- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation implementation
- 🔍 Efficient document retrieval system
- 💡 Context-aware response generation
- 🎯 Improved answer accuracy
